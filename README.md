# simple-async-memo

A minimalistic, reasonably fast (see [alternatives below](#alternatives)) memoization
library with lazy cache renewal specifically for Promise-based usage.

Rejection is generally considered an unacceptable result. Hence, whenever calling the function
to be memoized is required (either the initial call or on cache expiration - see `maxAge`),
simple-async-memo will retry on every call (but you can also customize the interval at which
this happens - see `rejectRetryDelay`).

If the initial call results in rejection, this will still be returned though.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add simple-async-memo
```

## Example

```js
const {memoize} = require('simple-async-memo');

function fn(arg1, arg2) {
    return fetch('...');
}

const memoized = memoize(fn); // fn HAS to return a Promise!

memoized('foo', 'bar')
    .then(...)
    .catch(...);
memoized('foo', 'bar')
    .then(...)
    .catch(...);
```

## Options

### `maxAge`

**Default: MAX_SAFE_INTEGER \* 0.5**

So by default, the cache doesn't expire.

### `rejectRetryDelay`

**Default: 10000 ms**

This does not mean that `simple-async-memo` keeps retrying by itself. Instead, if you e.g. call a function regularly every 200 ms and you set this delay to 500 ms, if
the initial call failed, `simple-async-memo` will not retry for the first 2 calls but only the 3rd. IF that one succeeds, the cache will be updated lazily - meaning, only
the 4th call will get the resolved value.

### `matchesKey: (any[], any[]) => boolean`

**Default: shallow comparison of all array elements**

## Alternatives <a name="alternatives"></a>

[Moize](https://github.com/planttheidea/moize) offers great performance and has async options but unfortunately not the type of lazy cache renewal I was looking for. And its architecture is structured in a way that doesn't allow for contributing such a feature easily. (If this changes, let me know ðŸ˜‰)

[fast-memoize](https://github.com/caiogondim/fast-memoize.js) - quite possibly currently the fastest memoization library but no special async support and because it stringifies arguments (if you use more than 1), it doesn't play well with anything that doesn't show up in that (such as functions and symbols) out of the box.
